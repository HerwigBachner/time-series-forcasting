# Time Series Forcasting using Tensorflow Neural Networks
Contains some examples about Time Series Forecasting using Tensorflow Neural Networks.

### Data:
In many of these examples I use a public dataset called AirPassengers. This dataset provides monthly totals of a US airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. This dataset was originally taken from an inbuilt dataset of R called AirPassengers. The copy of the dataset in the data folder was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rakannimer/air-passengers).
